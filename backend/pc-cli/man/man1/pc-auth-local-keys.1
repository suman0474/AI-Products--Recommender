.PP
pc-auth-local-keys - Work with API keys that the CLI is managing in local state


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBpc auth local-keys  [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Work with API keys that the CLI is managing in local state.

.PP
When authenticated with user login or a service account, the CLI automatically
creates and manages API keys for control and data plane operations. This happens
transparently, the first time you run a control/data plane command ('pc index list').
You can also create a new key yourself and store it as a managed key using
'pc api-key create --store'.
