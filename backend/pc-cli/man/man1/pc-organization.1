.SH NAME
.PP
pc-organization - Manage Pinecone organizations


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBpc organization [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manage Pinecone organizations.

.PP
A Pinecone organization is a set of projects that use the same billing. Organizations allow
one or more users to control billing and project permissions for all of the projects belonging
to the organization.

.PP
When authenticating with Pinecone through the CLI, organizations are intrinsically linked to
user credentials. If you authenticate using 'pc auth login' (using the web browser), you can
target, list and manage any organizations linked to that account. If you authenticate using a
service account or an explicit API key, the CLI automatically targets the organization associated
with that account.
